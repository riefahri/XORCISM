"""
seed_crisis_scenarios.py — seed a baseline library of crisis-management scenario templates
(XCOMPLIANCE.CRISISSCENARIO) with their tabletop-exercise injects (XCOMPLIANCE.EXERCISEINJECT,
template rows = AuditID NULL), for the Crisis Management view (/crisis-management).
Jerome Athias - XORCISM

Each scenario is a ready-to-run tabletop exercise (TTX): a realistic crisis narrative plus a
timed sequence of injects (events / decisions / escalations) and the expected response for each.
From the Crisis Management page you "Run exercise" on a scenario → it creates an audit of type
'Tabletop Exercise' and copies these injects into it.

Idempotent: keyed on (ScenarioName, TenantID) — re-running updates the scenario and replaces its
template injects rather than duplicating.

    python seed_crisis_scenarios.py                # tenant 3 (default)
    python seed_crisis_scenarios.py --tenant 3
    python seed_crisis_scenarios.py --list         # show what would be written
