/**
 * journeys.ts — Guided compliance-journey wizard (XCOMPLIANCE backend).
 *
 * A curated catalogue of framework "journeys" (ISO 27001/42001, SOC 2, NIST CSF/800-53, NIS2, DORA,
 * EU CRA, MiCA, FedRAMP, GDPR…). Each journey is a phased, ordered checklist of concrete steps; every
 * step deep-links into the XORCISM module that actually does the work (risk register, controls,
 * policies, audits, evidence, SCA/SBOM, incidents…). Starting a journey materializes its steps into
 * COMPLIANCEJOURNEYSTEP (per-tenant), tracks status/progress, and optionally spawns a
 * COMPLIANCEASSESSMENT against the existing FRAMEWORK model.
